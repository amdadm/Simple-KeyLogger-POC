# Simple Keylogger PoC

## Overview
This is a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** project created for educational purposes and out of curiosity because I was bored.
It demonstrates how software that captures keyboard input behaves in a controlled environment.  

> ⚠️ **Important:** This project is intended for academic learning and defensive research only.  
> Do **not** use this software on other people's computers without explicit consent.  

## Features
- Captures keystrokes in a controlled environment
- Demonstrates logging mechanisms safely
- Designed for research, learning, and understanding input monitoring

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to:
- Study the behavior of input-capturing software
- Understand potential security risks
- Explore defensive techniques to detect and mitigate malicious software
